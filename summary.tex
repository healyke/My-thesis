Predator-prey interactions are an important evolutionary driver of species form an diversity and a central component of ecosystem structure. However, the context dependent nature of these interactions, as reflected by the diversity of species involved, means that understanding them at a fundamental level is required for better and more general ecological predictions. In this thesis I explore the role of two fundamental components of predator-prey interactions: the body size of both predators and their prey and the dimensionality of the interactions between them. I investigate the fundamental role of body size and habitat dimensionality across three chapters that represent stand-alone publications consisting of: the role of body size on the ability of species to perceive the temporal dimension of their environment; the role of habitat dimensionality and other traits relating to predation pressure on life history evolution; and the role of habitat dimensionality on the evolution of venom in snakes. Throughout my thesis I use comparative approaches to show that both habitat dimensionality and body size are key components that determine the mechanics of predator-prey interactions and hence ecological and evolutionary systems as a whole.
