%Its eight years since I first passed through the front gates of Trinty as a bushy tailed undergrade and I have been lucky to have met and recieved the help and kindness of so many people, without which I certainly would not have gotten to at least the brink of the big Dr (pending). For even getting me to my degree I would like to thank both Dr Trevor Hodkinson and Dr John Rochford who helped me transfer to Zoology in my first year (the second best decision of my life so far), despite missing several deadlines. To Prof. Celia Holland for inspring me to chase my intrests as an undergradute and for giuding me patiently through my undergradute thesis. A big thank you to my supervisor Andrew Jackon who not only gave me the oppertunity to do science but the full license to do the type of science that put a smile on my face for the last four years.
